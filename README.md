# Material Allocation API

A production-quality inventory allocation backend built with ASP.NET Core 8, PostgreSQL, EF Core 8, and Dapper. The domain models a constrained-inventory problem where competing orders must be filled from a shared pool of abstract SKUs under strict transactional guarantees — a pattern that directly mirrors semiconductor supply chain allocation (Micron-style).

## Domain Model — How It Maps to a Real Supply Chain

In a memory/storage supply chain, a fixed quantity of finished goods (DIMMs, NAND modules) is allocated to customers in priority order. Multiple orders arrive simultaneously, referencing the same SKU. The core problem is: under concurrent demand, no order should receive more units than are available, and no unit should be counted twice.

```
Sku ──────────────────────────── one SKU = one product variant (e.g. DDR5-16G, NAND-1T)
 └── InventoryAdjustment         signed audit record every time on_hand changes outside allocation
Order ────────────────────────── one order = one allocation request from one customer
 └── OrderLine                   one line per SKU requested — qty requested vs. qty allocated
      └── Reservation            optional soft hold on available units for a TTL window
```

### Sku

A `Sku` represents a single product variant. `SkuCode` is the natural key (e.g. `MEM-DDR5-16G`). `OnHand` is the mutable available-to-allocate count: it decrements atomically when units are allocated and increments when an allocation is cancelled. `Version` is an EF Core concurrency token — it increments on every write and is used to detect concurrent modifications on the adjust endpoint.

### InventoryAdjustment

Each `POST /skus/{id}/adjust` call writes an `InventoryAdjustment` row alongside the `on_hand` update, providing a full audit trail of every stock movement that happened outside the allocation flow (receipts, write-offs, corrections).

### Order

An `Order` carries a `ReferenceCode` (caller-assigned natural key), a `Priority` (`standard`, `high`, `critical`), and a `Status` that tracks its lifecycle: `open` → `partially_allocated` → `fully_allocated`, or `open` → `cancelled`. Status is recomputed from line quantities after every allocation run.

### OrderLine

An `OrderLine` is the allocation unit: one line per SKU per order, with `RequestedQty` (what was asked for) and `AllocatedQty` (what has been committed so far). The database enforces `allocated_qty <= requested_qty` via a CHECK constraint.

### Reservation

A `Reservation` places a soft hold on units for a specific order line until `ExpiresAt`. The availability formula becomes `available = on_hand - reserved` (where `on_hand` already reflects committed allocations). A background job expires stale reservations. Calling reserve again for the same order replaces the existing reservation (TTL refresh).

## Features

- **SKU Catalog** — create SKUs with initial on-hand quantity; paginated list ordered by SKU code; get by ID
- **Inventory Adjustments** — signed delta adjustments with mandatory reason text; full audit trail in `inventory_adjustments`; optimistic concurrency on adjust with 409 on version conflict
- **Availability Query** — `GET /skus/{id}/availability` returns `on_hand`, `reserved`, and `available = on_hand - reserved` in one read
- **Order Management** — create orders with one or more lines referencing existing SKUs; paginated list with optional `status` filter; unique `reference_code` enforced at DB level
- **Allocation Run** — `POST /orders/{id}/allocate` fills open lines against current stock in a single transaction; pessimistic `SELECT … FOR UPDATE` on SKU rows in deterministic (sku_id ascending) order prevents deadlocks; partial allocation allowed — unfulfilled lines remain open; response states partial vs. full explicitly
- **Cancellation & Release** — `POST /orders/{id}/cancel` transitions the order to `cancelled` and atomically restores `on_hand` from each line's `allocated_qty`; cancel uses the same lock order as allocate to prevent concurrent allocation/cancel deadlocks
- **Reservations** — `POST /orders/{id}/reserve` places a TTL-bounded hold per line against available stock; own-order reservation does not block own allocation; calling reserve again replaces the existing hold (idempotent TTL refresh)
- **Reservation Release** — `POST /reservations/{id}/release` explicitly removes a reservation before it expires
- **Reservation Expiry Job** — `ReservationExpiryJob` runs on a configurable interval (default 60 s) and deletes all rows where `expires_at <= NOW()`, restoring their quantity to availability automatically
- **Shortage Rollup** — `GET /rollup/sku-shortages` returns a paged, shortage-descending list of SKUs where open unfulfilled demand exceeds available stock; open demand accounts for active reservations (a line covered by a reservation does not count as unmet demand); pure Dapper read with a single CTE shared between the COUNT and the paged SELECT
- **Standard Envelope** — all responses use `{ success, statusCode, data, error }`; validation errors use the same shape; `[ApiController]` model-validation is overridden to produce the standard envelope instead of `ValidationProblemDetails`
- **Swagger UI** — OpenAPI spec (Swashbuckle) with XML doc annotations, available at `/swagger` in Development
- **Two-Role DB** — migrations run under a privileged migrator role; the app role (`dotnetter`) holds DML-only grants, so a compromised app process cannot alter schema
- **SKU Seed Data** — 5 representative memory/NAND SKUs seeded on first startup (idempotent)

## Architecture

```
HTTP request → Middleware (ExceptionHandler) → Controllers → Services → EF Core / Dapper → PostgreSQL
```

Services are the only layer that touches the database. Controllers translate HTTP concerns (query params, status codes, response envelope) and delegate all business logic to the service layer. EF Core handles writes, aggregate loads, and raw-SQL locking queries; Dapper is used for multi-result read queries (order details with lines, paginated lists) where the result shape doesn't map cleanly to aggregate roots.

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|---|---|
| Server | ASP.NET Core 8 (.NET 8.0) |
| Database | PostgreSQL 15+ with EF Core 8 (code-first migrations) |
| Micro-ORM | Dapper 2.1 |
| Background worker | `BackgroundService` (`ReservationExpiryJob`) |
| Docs | Swagger / OpenAPI (Swashbuckle) |
| Testing | xUnit + `WebApplicationFactory<Program>` — real Postgres database |

## Architecture Decisions

### Pessimistic locking with deterministic lock order

Allocation and cancellation both run inside explicit transactions and lock SKU rows via `SELECT * FROM skus WHERE id = ANY(@ids) ORDER BY id FOR UPDATE`. Sorting by `sku_id` ascending before acquiring locks is the key invariant: any two concurrent transactions that share SKUs will acquire their locks in the same order, eliminating circular waits.

Optimistic concurrency (`version` token on `Sku`) is used only on the adjust endpoint, where contention is low and a retry is cheap. Allocation and cancel use pessimistic locking because they read and immediately write multiple rows — a lost-update under optimistic concurrency would require re-reading and re-running the entire allocation loop, which is more complex for no real benefit at expected concurrency levels.

### Mutable `on_hand` vs. ledger

`on_hand` is a mutable integer that is decremented atomically at allocation commit time. This keeps availability queries simple: `available = on_hand - reserved`. A ledger-based model (sum of event rows) would be more auditable but adds query complexity without changing the core invariants. The `inventory_adjustments` table provides an audit trail for manual stock movements.

### Availability formula

```
available = on_hand - reserved
```

`on_hand` already excludes committed allocations (allocation decrements it at commit). `reserved` is the sum of non-expired reservation quantities across all orders' lines for this SKU. Allocated units are not subtracted again — they were already removed from `on_hand` at the time they were committed.

### Reservations inside the allocation lock

`ReserveAsync` acquires the same `FOR UPDATE` lock on SKU rows before reading reservation totals from other orders. This guarantees that the reservation count read inside the transaction sees the latest committed state — no concurrent reserve or allocate can insert a new reservation for these SKUs between the lock acquisition and the commit.

### EF Core + Dapper together

EF Core owns writes (aggregate mutations, reservation inserts) and raw-SQL locking queries (`FromSqlRaw`). Dapper is used for multi-result read queries (order detail with lines, paginated order list) where mapping a tuple result to a domain aggregate is unnecessary overhead and raw SQL is clearer.

### Two-role database

Migrations run under `material_allocation_migrator` (DDL privileges). The app runs as `dotnetter` (DML-only: `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`). A compromised app process cannot drop or alter tables. `ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES FOR ROLE material_allocation_migrator` ensures new tables automatically grant DML to `dotnetter`.

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- .NET 8 SDK
- PostgreSQL 15+

### Install

```bash
cd MaterialAllocationApi
dotnet restore
```

### Configure

Edit `appsettings.json`:

```json
{
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "Postgres": "Host=localhost;Port=5432;Database=material_allocation;Username=dotnetter;Password=<pass>",
    "PostgresMigrator": "Host=localhost;Port=5432;Database=material_allocation;Username=material_allocation_migrator;Password=<pass>"
  },
  "ReservationExpiry": {
    "IntervalSeconds": 60
  }
}
```

Two connection strings are required: `Postgres` for the app role (DML only) and `PostgresMigrator` for the migration role (DDL). Create both roles in Postgres before running:

```sql
CREATE ROLE dotnetter LOGIN PASSWORD '<pass>';
CREATE ROLE material_allocation_migrator LOGIN PASSWORD '<pass>';
GRANT ALL ON DATABASE material_allocation TO material_allocation_migrator;
ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES FOR ROLE material_allocation_migrator IN SCHEMA public
  GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON TABLES TO dotnetter;
```

### Run

```bash
# Migrations and SKU seed run automatically on startup — no separate step needed.
dotnet run
```

Swagger UI: `http://localhost:<port>/swagger` (Development only).

## API Reference

All endpoints are prefixed `/api/v1`. Responses follow the standard envelope:

```json
{ "success": true, "statusCode": 200, "data": {}, "error": null }
```

Error response:

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "statusCode": 409,
  "data": null,
  "error": { "message": "Order is already cancelled.", "code": "ORDER_ALREADY_CANCELLED" }
}
```

Returns the updated order. Returns 409 if the order is already cancelled.

**POST `/orders/{id}/allocate` response:**

Fills open lines from current `on_hand`. Respects active reservations held by other orders — their reserved quantities are excluded from available stock. An order's own reservations do not block its own allocation.

Returns the allocation result:
